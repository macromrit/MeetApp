### **Find and Connect with Like-Minded People!**

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

MeetApp uses advanced matching algorithms to pair users based on their bios, partner preferences, and cuisine preferences. Our unique scoring system combines multiple similarity scores into a single composite score using an **ensemble evaluation mechanism**. This ensures that our recommendations are not only accurate but also tailored to each user's personality and preferences.

The primary features include:
- **User Profiles**: Users can create detailed bios, set their preferences for partners, and indicate their favorite cuisines.
- **Advanced Matching Algorithm**: MeetApp leverages a sophisticated ensemble scoring technique, combining various metrics into a weighted average for better matching.
- **Socializing and Meetups**: Once matched, users can initiate conversations, plan meetups, and build lasting relationships.

## 🧠 **Key Features**

- **Bio & Preferences**: Users provide detailed personal information and preferences to tailor their match suggestions.
- **Cuisine Preferences**: Filter and match people who share your culinary tastes.
- **Ensemble Scoring**: Uses multiple algorithms and weighted averages to offer the best matches.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Chat and meet up with people through the app.

## 📈 **How Matching Works**

Our matching algorithm evaluates users' preferences based on:

1. **Bio Similarity**: Matching users with similar life goals, hobbies, and interests.
2. **Partner Preferences**: Ensuring users meet the criteria they set for their ideal partner.
3. **Cuisine Preferences**: Matching users based on shared favorite cuisines.
4. **Ensemble Scoring**: We use a combination of various matching models, weighted together, to generate a single match score.

This unique combination ensures that users receive the best possible matches, with recommendations fine-tuned over time based on feedback and usage patterns.
